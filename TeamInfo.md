## Project Summary

The project aims to develop an interactive web application that estimates happiness levels across various regions in the United States, down to the zip code level. By utilizing publicly available datasets on factors like crime rates, income, air quality, and mental health services, the application will provide users with a detailed analysis of happiness in specific areas along with updates on recent news near the selected location. Users can interact with a geo-coded heatmap, search for happiness scores by location, and update their own happiness ratings over time. Moreover, city officials can utilize the application to get deeper insight into the well-being of their residents and make more precise decisions about the resources allocation.
